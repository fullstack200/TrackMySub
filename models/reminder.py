class Reminder:
    '''
    Reminder class for managing and sending payment reminders for user subscriptions.
    Attributes:
        user (User): The user associated with the reminders. Must be an instance of User.
        user_reminder_acknowledged (dict): A dictionary mapping subscription names (str) to a boolean flag indicating whether the payment reminder has been acknowledged.
    Methods:
        check_payment_date():
            Checks all active subscriptions for the user and determines if a payment reminder should be sent based on the subscription's renewal date and billing frequency.
            Sends a reminder 3 days before the renewal date if not already acknowledged, and resets the acknowledgement flag once the renewal date has arrived or passed.
        remind_payment(subscription):
            Sends (prints) a payment reminder for the given subscription.
    Properties:
        user:
            Getter and setter for the user attribute. Ensures the user is an instance of User.
        user_reminder_acknowledged:
            Getter and setter for the user_reminder_acknowledged attribute. Ensures the value is a dictionary mapping str keys to bool values.
    Raises:
        TypeError: If the user is not an instance of User, or if user_reminder_acknowledged is not a dict mapping str to bool.
