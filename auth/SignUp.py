        Execute the sign-up flow.

        Steps performed:
        1. Prompt the user to enter a unique username, email ID, and password.
        2. Validate that all fields are provided; if any field is empty, terminate.
        3. Check if the username already exists in the database.
            - If it exists, notify the user and terminate.
            - If it does not exist, create a new User instance and insert it into the database.
        4. Provide success or error messages with appropriate delays.
        5. Ensure the database cursor is closed after the operation.

        Exceptions:
            Catches any database or insertion errors and displays an error message.

        Notes:
            - Uses `getpass.getpass` for secure password input without echoing.
            - Uses `time.sleep` to provide delays for better user experience.
            - Assumes `db_connection` and `insert_user` are defined and available globally.
