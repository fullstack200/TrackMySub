        Execute the sign-in flow.

        Steps performed:
        1. Prompt the user to enter their username and password.
        2. Validate that both fields are non-empty.
            - If either field is empty, notify the user and terminate.
        3. Attempt to fetch the user from the database using `fetch_user`.
            - If user is not found, notify about invalid credentials.
            - If user is found:
                a. Fetch all subscriptions and add them to the user.
                b. Fetch the user's budget and associate it.
                c. Fetch all monthly reports, yearly reports, usages, and reminders.
                d. Instantiate a `Dashboard` object with all fetched data and show it.
        4. Provide user feedback with delays using `time.sleep`.

        Exceptions:
            Any database or fetching errors should be handled by the underlying
            fetch functions and not by this method.

        Notes:
            - Uses `getpass.getpass` to securely input passwords without echo.
            - Assumes that `fetch_user`, `fetch_all_subscription`, `fetch_budget`,
              `fetch_all_monthly_reports`, `fetch_all_yearly_reports`, 
              `fetch_all_usages`, `fetch_all_reminders`, and `Dashboard` 
              are defined and available globally.
